# Uncommon R Subsetting Errors using subset function
This repository demonstrates some uncommon errors that can occur when using the `subset` function in R, particularly those related to vector comparisons and the `select` argument.  The code showcases incorrect usage and provides the corrected versions.

The examples highlight how subtle mistakes can lead to unexpected results or errors, especially when dealing with multiple conditions or selecting specific columns.

## Issues Addressed
* Incorrect use of vector comparison within `subset` conditions.
* Misuse of logical operations within `select` argument.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.r` to see the code illustrating the errors.
3. Open `bugSolution.r` to see the corrected code. 
4. Run the code in an R environment to observe the outputs.
