# Corrected code demonstrating proper use of subset with vector comparison

df <- data.frame(x = c(1, 2, 3), y = c(4, 5, 6))

# Correct way to use subset with multiple conditions:
correct_subset_df <- subset(df, x > 1 & y < 6) #this will work as expected 

#Another corrected example
df <- data.frame(a=c(1,2,3), b=c(4,5,6), c=c(7,8,9))

#correct way to select columns based on a condition:
correct_subset_df <- subset(df, subset = c >7, select = c(a,b))
print(correct_subset_df)
